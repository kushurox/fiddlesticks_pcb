# Fiddle Sticks

**Fiddle Sticks** is a hobby flight controller (FC) project I designed using an **STM32F411** MCU and lightweight **coreless motors**. This is my personal project to learn PCB design and get hands-on experience with embedded development.

## About

- **MCU:** STM32F411
- **Motors:** 8520 Coreless DC (brushed)
- **Sensor:** ICM-45605 (symbol from SnapEDA — you will need to download it from SnapEDA if you want to use it)
- **Purpose:** Hobby learning project for PCB design, firmware development, and embedded systems

## Project Goals

1. Learn PCB design workflow.
2. Interface STM32F411 with coreless motors and sensors.
3. Flash my own **Rust-written firmware** onto the board in the future.
4. Experiment with flight controller concepts in a low-risk hobby setting.

## Notes

- This is **not a production-ready drone FC** — it’s purely for learning and experimentation.
- If you want to use the ICM-45605 footprint/symbol, please get it from **[SnapEDA](https://www.snapeda.com/)**.

This project is open for learning purposes. Check the LICENSE file for details.
